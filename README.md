Student Management System

A simple Python project to manage student records. This program lets users add, view, search, and delete student details in an interactive menu-driven interface. It is built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

Features:

- Add a new student (roll number, name, marks).
- View the list of all students.
- Search for a student by roll number.
- Delete a student record.
- Exit the program.

Usage:

  - Use the menu to interact with the system:
  - Add, view, search, or delete student records.
  - Exit when done.

Future Enhancements:

- Save data to a file or database for persistence.
- Add input validation and error handling.
- Implement a graphical user interface (GUI).
